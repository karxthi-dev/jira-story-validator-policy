Last updated: April 8, 2025

Jira Story Validator ("we", "our", or "us") is an Atlassian Forge app designed to help users evaluate and improve the quality of user stories within Jira by validating them against defined acceptance criteria. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your information.

1. Data We Collect
Our app may collect and process the following information from your Jira instance:

Issue key, summary, and description

User ID (only if necessary for validation context)

Comments or content entered by users into the app

Validation result data, calculated via our backend API

Note: We do not collect or store sensitive personal data unless explicitly required for functionality.

2. How We Use Your Data
We use the collected data to:

Analyze Jira user story content (e.g., summary and description)

Run validation logic through our remote API

Enhance app accuracy and performance

We do not use or share this data for any marketing, profiling, or advertising purposes.

3. Data Storage and Retention
When data is sent to our remote service:

It is encrypted in transit using HTTPS

It is not persistently stored, unless anonymized logs are needed for debugging or monitoring

All request data is automatically deleted within 24 hours, unless extended retention is required for troubleshooting (anonymized only).

The app communicates only with our secure remote API endpoint used for validation purposes.
